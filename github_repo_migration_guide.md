## ‚úÖ Solution Options

### Option 1: Transfer Ownership (Recommended if you own both accounts)

#### Steps:
1. Go to the **original repository** on GitHub.
2. Click on **Settings**.
3. Scroll down to the **Danger Zone**.
4. Click **Transfer Ownership**.
5. Enter the **target username/organization** and confirm.

**Pros:**
- Keeps issues, stars, forks, pull requests, etc.
- GitHub handles everything.

### Option 2: Clone and Push to New Repository (if you want to duplicate it)

#### Steps:
1. Clone the original repository as a bare repo:
   ```bash
   git clone --bare https://github.com/old-username/repo-name.git
   cd repo-name.git
   ```

2. Create a new repository in your new GitHub account.

3. Push the mirrored content to the new repository:
   ```bash
   git push --mirror https://github.com/new-username/repo-name.git
   ```

4. (Optional) Remove the local bare repo:
   ```bash
   cd ..
   rm -rf repo-name.git
   ```

**Pros:**
- Full commit history is retained.
- You can change visibility, README, etc.

## üîç What does `--bare` do in `git clone --bare`?

The `--bare` flag tells Git to clone only the repository data (branches, tags, commit history), **without a working directory**.
